{"name":"Gridmap","tagline":"A small Python script for mapping events on a picture","body":"GridMap\r\n========\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n--------\r\n\r\nA mapping tool intented for level design. Once the setup is done, you can find events in a log file and print a density map over an existing picture.  \r\nThis tool was developped for DeepVoid (http://deepvoid.eu).\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n--------\r\n\r\nYou can call the script this way : gridmap.py event resolution  \r\n\"event\" will specify the event name to be searched in log. Events have a specific format.  \r\n\"resolution\" will specify the size of the computing unit, defined in real-world units (those used in the log file).  \r\n  \r\nThe format used in log is the following : \"DVL/SHOOT/X/-305.2567/Y/-1557.8965/Z/46.5563/EDL\"  \r\nIt starts and ends by specific markers DVL and EDL, starts with the event name (\"SHOOT\" here) then stores the X, Y, Z coordinates.  \r\n  \r\nThe input log file has to be named \"Launch.log\".  \r\nThe input picture file is hardcoded.  \r\nThe output file is saved with the _heatmap extension after the source image name.  \r\n\r\n\r\nHardcoded parameters\r\n--------\r\n\r\nAnytime you change the original picture, you will have to edit the script.  \r\n  \r\nxmin = X coordinate of the picture left, in real world units  \r\nxmax = X coordinate of the picture right, in real world units  \r\nymin = Y coordinate of the picture bottom, in real world units  \r\nymax = Y coordinate of the picture top, in real world units  \r\nlogBase : log base to use in calculation  \r\nbendAmount : amount of color to draw over the picture, from 0 to 1  \r\nunrealToPixelRatio : size of a pixel, in real world units  \r\nsourceImage : PNG file to use as a picture reference  \r\n\r\n\r\nContact, people, etc\r\n--------\r\n\r\nGridMap is developped by GwennaÃ«l ARBONA.  \r\nIn case of bugs, questions, requests, ideas, please use the message system on GitHub.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
